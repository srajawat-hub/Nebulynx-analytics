# 📧 Email Notification Solutions

## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS: Email is Working!**

Your Resend API key is properly configured and emails are being sent successfully. However, there are some limitations with the free tier.

## 🔍 **THE ISSUE: Resend Free Tier Limitations**

### **What's Working:**
- ✅ API key is valid
- ✅ Email sending is functional
- ✅ Professional email templates
- ✅ 100 free emails per day

### **The Limitation:**
- ❌ **Can only send to your verified email**: `shailendra@inclusivelayer.com`
- ❌ **Cannot send to other email addresses** without domain verification

## 🚀 **SOLUTION OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Use Your Verified Email (IMMEDIATE FIX)**
**Status**: ✅ **READY TO USE**

Your alert is now configured to send emails to your verified address. You should receive email notifications when BTC goes above $118,300.

**To test it:**
1. The current BTC price is $118,372.21
2. Your alert is set for "above $118,300"
3. You should receive an email notification soon!

### **Option 2: Verify Your Domain (RECOMMENDED)**

**Steps to verify your domain:**
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Add the required DNS records
4. Wait for verification (usually 24-48 hours)
5. Update the `from` address in the code

**Benefits:**
- Send emails to any address
- Professional branding
- Higher email limits
- Better deliverability
